# Project Setup Guide

To run the project, follow these steps:

1. **Open two terminals**:

   - In the first terminal, run the following command to start the mock API:
   - In folder `database`, run:
     ```bash
     npm start
     ```
   - In the second terminal, run the following command to start the development server:
     ```bash
     npm run dev
     ```

2. **About the Mock API**:
   - The todo items are stored in the `mock` folder, which serves as a mock API folder for simulating backend interactions.
