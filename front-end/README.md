# Project Setup Guide

To run the project, follow these steps:

1. **Open two terminals**:

   - In the first terminal, run the following command to start the mock API:
   - In folder `database`, run:
     ```bash
     npm start
     ```
   - In the second terminal, run the following command to start the development server:
     ```bash

     ```
